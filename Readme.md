# Full Stack Web Development Project

This is my first full stack web development project, built using React for the client-side, Express for the server-side, and MongoDB for the database. Throughout the development process, I learned and utilized various packages and technologies, including:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data
- bcrypt: A package for hashing passwords
- body-parser: A middleware for parsing request bodies
- cors: A package for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- dotenv: A package for managing environment variables
- mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js
- react-redux: A package for managing application state in React with Redux
- redux toolkit: A package for efficient Redux development
- Material-UI: A popular React component library for building UIs
